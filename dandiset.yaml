description: 'The enclosed data is collected using a high-density 256-channel electrocorticography
  (ECoG) array implanted in human patients during treatment for epilepsy. The subjects
  are reading aloud consonant-vowel syllables from a list. The data was collected
  by Dr. Edward Chang and Dr. Kristofer Bouchard at the University of California,
  San Francisco, and curated by Dr. Kristofer Bouchard and Dr. Benjamin Dichter.



  Data is organized by subject ID, and each file is a continuous recording session
  in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) 2.0 format. Voltage traces are included for each
  of the recorded 256 channels. Microphone signal was recorded at the time but is
  removed for HIPAA compliance. Detailed hand-marked annotations are provided which
  mark what syllable was said, and the times of the start, consonant-vowel transition,
  and end of each syllable. A rest-period time is also included when the subject was
  silent, which can be used as a baseline. Hand-marked anatomical labels are included
  for electrodes in the relevant brain regions. All dates have been removed for HIPAA
  compliance and replaced with Jan 1, 1900.'
